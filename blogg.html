                      <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 Refunds</h1>
                      <p>
                        Last night, Sony announced that it was pulling Cyberpunk
                        2077 from the PlayStation Store, and that the company
                        would begin offering refunds to all PlayStation 4 and
                        PlayStation 5 gamers who purchased the game. It’s a
                        shame. CD Projekt Red has had, up to this point, one of
                        the most sterling reputations in the gaming industry.
                        Thanks not only to incredible games like The Witcher 2
                        and The Witcher 3, but to a record of pro-consumer
                        policies such as free DLC and top-notch support, CDPR
                        was one of a very small handful of game developers to
                        enjoy a near unassailable status. That has changed
                        almost overnight as gamers realized what a disaster
                        Cyberpunk 2077 was on PS4 and Xbox One, especially the
                        base models of those two consoles. With no true next-gen
                        version, the only console versions out there were a
                        buggy mess, and the game’s graphics fell far short of
                        what we’d expect on even the base PS4 and Xbox One.

                      <h1>Video games are bad</h1>
                      <p>
                        Lots of kids love video games. In fact, they like them
                        so much that they might hear something like this from
                        mom or dad: "Enough! Find something else to do!" It can
                        be good advice, even if you were about to get to the
                        next level. Why? Too much of anything is just too much.
                        It's true that some studies have shown certain video
                        games can improve hand–eye coordination, problem-solving
                        skills, and the mind's ability to process information.
                        But too much video game playing may cause problems. It's
                        hard to get enough active play and exercise if you're
                        always inside playing video games. And without enough
                        exercise, kids can become overweight. Overdoing video
                        games also could affect other important stuff, like
                        friendships and how well a kid does in school. And kids
                        who play violent video games might act more
                        aggressively. But here's the good news: Playing video
                        games some of the time can be OK. Choose quality games,
                        and limit screen time — which includes TV, computer,
                        smartphone, tablet, and video game time combined — to a
                        reasonable amount. A good game will be the right one for
                        how old you are. Games are rated like movies and your
                        mom or dad can help figure out which ones you should
                        use. If you can choose one that gets you up and moving,
                        that's even better. You might challenge your mom, dad —
                        or even your grandma — to swing the bat in a game of
                        baseball or try out some fancy moves in one of the
                        dancing games. Could your grandma be a dancing queen?
                        Time to find out!

                      <h1>Minecraft cheating scandal</h1>
                      <p>
                        A brief summary of the cheating scandal surrounding
                        YouTube's biggest Minecraft speedrunner With 15.4
                        million subscribers and many of his videos hitting
                        anywhere between 20-60 million views, it's safe to say
                        that 2020 was one heck of a year for the Minecraft
                        YouTuber, Dream. The speedrunner quickly rose to fame,
                        gaining millions of followers so quickly that his
                        subscriber count grew by 12 million between January and
                        November last year alone. Even if you don't know much
                        about YouTube's breakout star of 2020, you might have
                        heard about the controversy surrounding his
                        record-breaking Minecraft speedrun after officials
                        concluded that cheating was involved, a situation that
                        has rolled on for months with claim and counter-claim
                        but, finally, seems settled. If you're wondering what
                        exactly happened and need a short explainer, here's a
                        breakdown. Dream's popularity is largely thanks to the
                        YouTuber's Minecraft speedrun videos, where he tries to
                        complete the game as fast as possible, and their
                        Minecraft manhunt series, which is ridiculously popular.
                        Dream's speedruns continually break records and make the
                        Minecraft world speedrun leaderboard, to the
                        astonishment of many viewers. During this success,
                        suspicions arose about the legitimacy of some of his
                        runs, and in particular, accusations arose about Dream
                        tampering with the game to get better luck. The
                        accusations arose in October 2020 from a fellow
                        Minecraft speedrunner (whose tweets have since been
                        deleted) who reported seeing higher RNG drops for key
                        items in a run submitted by Dream earlier that month,
                        the same run that placed 5th on the world leaderboards.

                        The Flight of the Birdman: Flappy Bird Creator Dong
                        Nguyen Speaks Out
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                        Last April, Dong Nguyen, a quiet 28-year-old who lived
                        with his parents in Hanoi, Vietnam, and had a day job
                        programming location devices for taxis, spent a holiday
                        weekend making a mobile game. He wanted it to be simple
                        but challenging, in the spirit of the Nintendo games he
                        grew up playing. The object was to fly a bug-eyed,
                        big-lipped, bloated bird between a series of green
                        vertical pipes. The quicker a player tapped the screen,
                        the higher the bird would flap. He called it Flappy
                        Bird. Game Never Over: 10 Most Addictive Video Games The
                        game went live on the iOS App Store on May 24th. Instead
                        of charging for Flappy Bird, Nguyen made it available
                        for free, and hoped to get a few hundred dollars a month
                        from in-game ads. But with about 25,000 new apps going
                        online every month, Flappy Bird was lost in the mix and
                        seemed like a bust – until, eight months later,
                        something crazy happened. The game went viral. By
                        February, it was topping the charts in more than 100
                        countries and had been downloaded more than 50 million
                        times. Nguyen was earning an estimated $50,000 a day.
                        Not even Mark Zuckerberg became rich so fast. Yet as
                        Flappymania peaked, Nguyen remained a mystery. Aside
                        from the occasional tweet, he had little to say about
                        his incredible story. He ducked the press and refused to
                        be photographed. He was called a fraud, a con man and a
                        thief. Bloggers accused him of stealing art from
                        Nintendo. The popular gaming site Kotaku wrote in a
                        widely clicked headline, FLAPPY BIRD IS MAKING $50,000 A
                        DAY OFF RIPPED ART. On February 9th, at 2:02 a.m. Hanoi
                        time, a message appeared on Nguyen’s Twitter account. “I
                        am sorry ‘Flappy Bird’ users,” it read. “22 hours from
                        now, I will take ‘Flappy Bird’ down. I cannot take this
                        anymore.” The message was retweeted more than 145,000
                        times by the disbelieving masses. How could someone who
                        hit the online jackpot suddenly pull the plug? But when
                        the clock struck midnight the next evening, the story
                        came to an end. Nguyen, as promised, took Flappy Bird
                        offline. In his wake, he left millions of jilted gamers,
                        and one big question: Who was this dude, and WTF had he
                        done?

                  There’s nothing like flipping on your favorite video game
                  after a long day at school. 60 percent of Americans play video
                  games daily. But while it may seem like a benign method of
                  relaxation, playing video games has significant effects on
                  your behavior.

                  biggest Minecraft speedrunner With 15.4 million subscribers
                  and many of his videos hitting anywhere between 20-60 million
                  views, it's safe to say that 2020 was one heck of a year for
