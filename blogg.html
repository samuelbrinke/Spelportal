                  <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 Refunds</h1>
                  <p>
                    Last night, Sony announced that it was pulling Cyberpunk
                    2077 from the PlayStation Store, and that the company would
                    begin offering refunds to all PlayStation 4 and PlayStation
                    5 gamers who purchased the game. It’s a shame. CD Projekt
                    Red has had, up to this point, one of the most sterling
                    reputations in the gaming industry. Thanks not only to
                    incredible games like The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3, but
                    to a record of pro-consumer policies such as free DLC and
                    top-notch support, CDPR was one of a very small handful of
                    game developers to enjoy a near unassailable status. That
                    has changed almost overnight as gamers realized what a
                    disaster Cyberpunk 2077 was on PS4 and Xbox One, especially
                    the base models of those two consoles. With no true next-gen
                    version, the only console versions out there were a buggy
                    mess, and the game’s graphics fell far short of what we’d
                    expect on even the base PS4 and Xbox One.

                  <h1>Video games are bad</h1>
                  <p>
                    Lots of kids love video games. In fact, they like them so
                    much that they might hear something like this from mom or
                    dad: "Enough! Find something else to do!" It can be good
                    advice, even if you were about to get to the next level.
                    Why? Too much of anything is just too much. It's true that
                    some studies have shown certain video games can improve
                    hand–eye coordination, problem-solving skills, and the
                    mind's ability to process information. But too much video
                    game playing may cause problems. It's hard to get enough
                    active play and exercise if you're always inside playing
                    video games. And without enough exercise, kids can become
                    overweight. Overdoing video games also could affect other
                    important stuff, like friendships and how well a kid does in
                    school. And kids who play violent video games might act more
                    aggressively. But here's the good news: Playing video games
                    some of the time can be OK. Choose quality games, and limit
                    screen time — which includes TV, computer, smartphone,
                    tablet, and video game time combined — to a reasonable
                    amount. A good game will be the right one for how old you
                    are. Games are rated like movies and your mom or dad can
                    help figure out which ones you should use. If you can choose
                    one that gets you up and moving, that's even better. You
                    might challenge your mom, dad — or even your grandma — to
                    swing the bat in a game of baseball or try out some fancy
                    moves in one of the dancing games. Could your grandma be a
                    dancing queen? Time to find out!

                  <p>
                    A brief summary of the cheating scandal surrounding
                    YouTube's biggest Minecraft speedrunner With 15.4 million
                    subscribers and many of his videos hitting anywhere between
                    20-60 million views, it's safe to say that 2020 was one heck
                    of a year for the Minecraft YouTuber, Dream. The speedrunner
                    quickly rose to fame, gaining millions of followers so
                    quickly that his subscriber count grew by 12 million between
                    January and November last year alone. Even if you don't know
                    much about YouTube's breakout star of 2020, you might have
                    heard about the controversy surrounding his record-breaking
                    Minecraft speedrun after officials concluded that cheating
                    was involved, a situation that has rolled on for months with
                    claim and counter-claim but, finally, seems settled. If
                    you're wondering what exactly happened and need a short
                    explainer, here's a breakdown. Dream's popularity is largely
                    thanks to the YouTuber's Minecraft speedrun videos, where he
                    tries to complete the game as fast as possible, and their
                    Minecraft manhunt series, which is ridiculously popular.
                    Dream's speedruns continually break records and make the
                    Minecraft world speedrun leaderboard, to the astonishment of
                    many viewers. During this success, suspicions arose about
                    the legitimacy of some of his runs, and in particular,
                    accusations arose about Dream tampering with the game to get
                    better luck. The accusations arose in October 2020 from a
                    fellow Minecraft speedrunner (whose tweets have since been
                    deleted) who reported seeing higher RNG drops for key items
                    in a run submitted by Dream earlier that month, the same run
                    that placed 5th on the world leaderboards.
